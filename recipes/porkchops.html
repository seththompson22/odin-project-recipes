    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>½ cup ketchup</li>
      <li>2 ⅔ tablespoons honey</li>
      <li>2 tablespoons low-sodium soy sauce</li>
      <li>2 cloves garlic, crushed</li>
      <li>6 (4 ounce) (1-inch thick) pork chops</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Directions</h3>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Preheat grill for medium heat and lightly oil the grate. Gather
        ingredients.
      </li>
      <li>
        Whisk ketchup, honey, soy sauce, and garlic together in a bowl to make a
        glaze.
      </li>
      <li>
        Sear the pork chops on both sides on the preheated grill. Lightly brush
        glaze onto each side of the chops as they cook; grill until no longer
        pink in the center, about 7 to 9 minutes per side. An instant-read
        thermometer inserted into the center should read 145 degrees F (63
        degrees C).

      <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
